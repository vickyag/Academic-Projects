Parliaments Central Hall he spoke about social justice in the context of allround development of  most backward districts identified and dubbed by his government as aspirational If all children go to schools and all households get electricity then it would be a step towards social justice the prime minister told the gathering of central ministers MPs and legislators from statesAsserting that shortage of budget or resources were not the reasons for lack of development but governance was Modi said good governance effective implementation of schemes and focussed activities were needed for development There used to be a time when hardcore politics roundtheclock politics involving agitations and struggle would work Time has changed Whether you are in power or in opposition what matters is whether if you come to peoples help he told parliamentarians and legislators from statesThings like how much agitation you did how many morchas you took out and how many times you went to jail would matter to your political career  years back but things have changed now Modi told the lawmakers and asked them to work towards fulfilling developmental targets in their regionsThe prime minister said that though he cannot ask them to leave hardcore politics but changes in society will make them do so A discussion on social justice is often confined to social conditions but there are more dimensions to it he said adding that if there is electricity in one home or one village but not in the neighbouring home or village social justice dictates that they too get electricityIn India the phrase social justice is loaded with political meaning as political parties especially those from Janata Parivar have used the plank to rally backward castes and other weaker sections of society around them The BJP under Modi has injected a narrative of development into this and often succeeded in winning over a large section of these communities in one election after another The prime

Patel sat in the Central Hall of Parliament to prepare the Constitution he likened the lawmakers presence in the hall today to a pilgrimage and pitched for development That parliamentarians and legislators from different parties are sitting together on the issue of development is a living example of federalism the prime minister said and asked them to work like a helping hand to state machineryHe said development in the  districts would be a work of social justice and if the lawmakers worked sincerely for one year with peoples participation it would bring about a sea change and help India go up in Human Development Index Governments have the tendency of focusing on what gives them results easily and it often results in developed districts doing better still while backward districts slide further Modi said adding his government has identified these  districts as aspirational and not backward as the latter has negative connotations We dont have to do a competition of backwards but of forwards he saidThe prime minister also called for posting young officers a reference to those directly from the IAS instead of those promoted to the all India service from state cadre with a sense of purpose as district magistrates in these places Modi said the average age of a district magistrate is generally  years but he was surprised to find in a meeting with officials of these  districts that  per cent of them were aged more than  yearsElder officers have many other concerns such as family and career and these districts should not be seen as places where anybody can be posted he said Working for development in these districts would also be a form of the social justice envisaged by the makers of our Constitution and there is little possibility of any fight in this the prime minister said He said it is necessary to identify the reasons for backwardness of these districts and once it is done then problems of  of them can be addressed easily in a similar manner troubles afflicting a diabetic person are cured once his disease is found out Rest of the  districts are hit by leftwing extremism Modi said If work is done on a mission mode with available resources and manpower then it will lead to very good results Where this has happened things have changed he saidUnderlining the importance of good governance the prime minister said his experience showed that

(56, 'State fiscal outlook worsens debt to cross Rs  lakhcrore', 'IN a fresh warning that Maharashtras fiscal outlook is worsening the states budget for  has projected that the states public debt will cross Rs  lakh crore by March  which could force the government to spend a staggering Rs  crore from its spending plan for  on servicing this debtIn its fourth budget since assuming office in Maharashtra the Devendra Fadnavis government on Friday spelt out a Rs  lakh crore expenditure plan with enhanced allocation for capital investments in the farmintensive and rural infrastructure sector headlining the budgetWith the rural economy which caters to the livelihood of  per cent of the states population the farm sector was again the focal point of Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwars budget speech in the Legislative Assembly No new tax levies were announced however Politically the budget attempted to make the right noises Facing heat over negative growth in the agriculture sector Mungantiwar devoted a major part of his budget speech to farm related announcements Through this budget the government would like to reaffirm its commitment of standing firmly behind farmers he said An amount of Rs  crore will be made available for the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana by NABARD to enhance irrigation capacity and to complete  major irrigation projects in the state on a priority basis up to But it was the worsening outlook of the states economy that stood out more prominently than new announcements and interventions that Mungantiwar made in his speechJust as the Centres th Finance Commission norms require states to maintain a revenue surplus position Maharashtra has consistently missed the target since  In  the revenue deficit number worsened alarmingly Even worse is the forecast of the deficit gap widening further in  While Mungantiwar had forecast a revenue deficit of Rs  crore at the start of  he said the actual revenue deficit for the year ending March  would cross Rs  crore or  per cent of the Gross State Domestic ProductIn  this deficit is further projected to grow to Rs  crore making it the worst ever deficit in the states history in absolute terms The governments fiscal policy statement has pointed a finger at some of the populist decisions taken by the Fadnavis government for the worsening of the deficit Various public welfare decisions taken by the government eg cancellation of local body tax cancellation of toll collected through publicprivate partnership on some roads have increased the burden on the state exchequer it stated The budget document further said that the loans availed for capitalintensive projects in the irrigation and the road development sector and the governments committed share in Metro rail projects had tremendously increased the financial burden In addition the state also undertook the liability of farm loan waiverMungantiwar informed the house that the government had so far cleared the loan waiver benefit worth over Rs  crore According to him the government has so far distributed Rs  crore under the farm loan waiver schemeIt warned that on account of the lingering impact of the loan waiver and the additional burden owing to the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations the revenue expenditure will increase further on a large scale which would lead to a further increase in the revenue deficitThe governments budgetary provisions for fulfilling the Seventh Pay Commission commitments may prove inadequate admitted officials Against an estimate that the pay hike for state government employees as per the Commissions recommendation would cost the state exchequer an annual additional burden of Rs  crore the states fiscal managers said the budget for  currently has an outlay of Rs  crore for the provision The state government has already indicated to give revised pay scales for its employees and pensioners with effect from January   Accordingly the Bakshi retd bureaucrat K P Bakshi committee has been constitutedThe Seventh Pay Commission will be implemented for state government employees on receipt of the committees report Adequate provision has been kept in the budget to meet this requirement Mungantiwar saidWhile the government thumped its back for surpassing the income target of Rs  crore set for  with collections expected to touch Rs  crore by March end an exponential rise in revenue expenditure from the targetted Rs  crore to Rs  crore resulted in the widening of the deficit gap In  Mungantiwar has forecast the revenue expenditure to further grow to Rs  lakh croreWith the governments salary and pension bill accounting for nearly  per cent of the revenues the fiscal manager has cited a concern The committed expenditure on salary pension and interest is increasing consistently thereby increasing the revenue expenditure Consequently capital expenditure cannot be increased in the required proportion Mungantiwar saidStarved of funds the public sector investment on capital expenditure has been squeezed further Due to spending cuts announced by the government for  the capital expenditure target of Rs  crore could not be met with the government ending up spending Rs  crore For the coming fiscal it has now set aside Rs  crore for capital works This accounts for just  per cent of the total spend estimates A white paper of the health of Maharashtras finances had earlier slammed the government for the consistent decline in the share of capital spendingThe fiscal deficit or gross borrowings of the state government in  was Rs  crore against a budgeted target of Rs  crore It stood at  per cent of the GSDP as against the budgeted target of  For  an optimistic fiscal deficit target of  or Rs  crore in absolute numbers has been set Replicating the Centres policy the cashstarved government has taken recourse to offbudget borrowings for all bigticket infrastructure projects  including the Mumbai Metro rail projects and the MumbaiNagpur Samruddhi Corridor  keeping them off the governments balance sheet Mungantiwar said that the fiscal deficitto the GSDP ratio was well within fiscal parametersThe downward slide in the share of nontax revenues is another worry admitted state government officials The share of nontax revenue in total receipts is  per cent This needs to increase Accordingly it is proposed to raise the present ratesfees under various laws and rules related to departments the finance department has saidTo shore up revenues and cut unproductive expenditure the government has said it would ensure timebound completion of projects and use direct benefit transfers to plug leakages in subsidiesMeanwhile after netting the highest collection under the Goods and Services Tax in  the government is banking on a further growth in tax collections After the implementation of the GST the number of tax payers in Maharashtra has increased significantly In the state  lakh tax payers are newly registered taking the number of tax payers under GST to  lakh At the end of the February  the state has garnered Rs  crore under GST Mungantiwar said The government has targeted a collection of Rs  crore through state GST and another Rs  crore under Integrated GST in  For  the government has allocated Rs  crore from the state budget for the scheme The total outlay for the irrigation sector to Rs  crore said MungantiwarFor improvement in road infrastructure Mungantiwar has pushed the ambitious project of construction and improvement of km roads under a Rs crore hybrid annuity model To improve roads in rural areas and to provide new roads for improved connectively funds have been made available under the Mukhya Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana The outlay for the road sector has been enhanced to Rs  crore The government also allocated Rs  crore for its flagship Jalyukt Shivar scheme aimed at droughtproofing villagesThe Finance Minister also invoked Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji right at start of his speech while announcing provision made for projects for building a Shivaji Memorial on an islet in the Arabian Sea and the Dr Ambedkar memorial at Dadars Indu millMungantiwar has also announced the setting up of the Maharashtra International Education Board to promote quality education of international levelsThe government has also enhanced the income limit for eligibility of

stated prior personal choice without being tethered to tubes and machines in a usually futile bid to slightly prolong life in a comatose state is a right that everyone must be granted Reddy said reacting to the Supreme Court ruling which recognised the right of a terminallyill patient to make an advance medical directive or living will refusing medical treatmentA recent study in the Lancet Commission on Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief had said that more than  million people worldwide die every year with serious physical and psychological suffering as a result of disease injury or illness M R Rajagopal chairman of Pallium India and a coauthor of the study said there are an estimated  million patients in India requiring palliative care every yearIt is a huge relief to see the Supreme Court judgment that makes an advanced medical directive legally binding on the medical profession he told The Indian Express This means that now if I prepare a document expressing my wish not to be subjected to aggressive lifeprolonging interventions in the face of an incurable terminal illness I have a chance of having my final hours or days with loved onesRajagopal is director of the Trivandrum Institute of Palliative Sciences the WHOcollaborating centre for policy and training on access to pain reliefHe said Till now advanced medical directives did not have legal validity in our country With todays ruling it becomes valid But this is only a beginning The legality is not the only issue The society must be willing to discuss death and prepare for it Also it is important to make sure that the legal procedures connected are as friendly as possibleI have to study the ruling in detail But I suspect that some of the procedures built into the implementation of advanced medical directives may be too cumbersome to be understood by the people who need themVikram Patel professor Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health said Supreme Courts observation that human beings have the right to die with dignity and that this extended to their right to give advanced directives or a living will to dictate their desires on endoflife care is entirely in keeping with the principles of personcentred careThis is in contrast to care which is driven by the medical industry whose heroic interventions to extend life can cause immense suffering to the dying person while only delaying the inevitable also emotionally and financially exhausting families It is certainly the kind of care that I would wish for myself Patel told The Indian ExpressK K Aggarwal former national president of Indian Medical Association said It is a landmark ruling Just as every person has the right to life heshe has the right to die with dignity In passive euthanasia the life support system of a terminally ill patient who is in a vegetative state is withdrawn In active euthanasia a patient is put to death through a lethal injection Active euthanasia has more likelihood of being misused by unscrupulous individuals to attain their ulterior motives and therefore may not be approvedAshok Bhanage head of the neurosurgery department at Ruby Hall Clinic applauded the judgment that has set some strict guidelines to be followed We get a lot of head injury cases where the patient goes into coma and leads a vegetative existence It is not just a torture for the person but also the entire family he saidNidhi Mishra founder of Senior Express an initiative to promote active and productive ageing said that while there was a right to live and die with dignity it was important to ensure

Kevadia the water level in the reservoir was  m just one metre short of the alltime high it has ever reached It was seven weeks before the Gujarat electionsOfficial records show the high level that day was achieved mainly because BJPruled Madhya Pradesh released an unusual amount of water from upstream dams over five days until the inaugurationAlso read Gujarat in fix as Sardar Sarovar water level at alarming lowIn fact on three of those five days records show the rate of flow into the reservoir was five times the limit   metres in  hours for initial filling  set by the Central Water Commission CWC the apex water regulatory bodyThe surge stopped the day of the ceremony see chartsWhile a former chairman of the CWC described the unprecedented release of water over those five days as optics for the inauguration ceremony officials associated with the dam said it was part of a dam safety exercise and that the timing was just a coincidenceRead At Holy Triveni Sangam in Gujarat Narmada is almost deadToday with Gujarat staring at a harsh summer the state government has announced that it will stop supplying water from the dam for irrigation of crops from March  Now consider what official records of the Narmada Control Authority NCA show about the unusual surge in flow of water from September  Levels swelled by  m in those five days In contrast it took  days from August   for the level to rise by about  m It then took  days from August September  for the reservoir to swell by  mThe live storage of the reservoir gained  million cubic metres MCM of water MP released  MCM in this period Live storage is the portion of water that can be released for irrigation and supply through power stations On average  litres per second flowed into the reservoir as compared to an average of  litres per second the previous week  a nearly sixfold jumpThe level began declining a week after touching a peak of  metres on September  the full reservoir level FRL is  metresWhen contacted a senior official of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited SSNNL said the water was released for safety inspections  the first time since the gates were lowered on June  Dam safety inspections were necessary by maintaining reservoir levels as per Indian Standard Codal provisions for the firsttime filling of the dam and as decided in the st meeting of the Sardar Sarovar Reservoir Regulation Committee held on June   in New Delhi said SSNNLs general manager incharge tech and coord A K SharmaTherefore Gujarat had requested to release its share of the utilisable water in the Narmada Basin so that testing could be undertaken he said in an emailed response The spike is just a coincidence said an official of the Narmada Control Authority NCA set up to monitor the sharing of Narmada waterThe dam was filled in accordance with a filling schedule to conduct a dam safety exercise to check inundation levels said the official who did not wish to be identifiedDespite repeated attempts by The Indian Express Lal Singh Arya MP Minister of State for Narmada Valley Development were not available for comment Rajneesh Vaish vice chairman Narmada Valley Development Corporation declined commentIn a statement Friday Nitin Patel Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister and incharge of Narmada acknowledged that the allocation of the rivers water to Gujarat is not linked with what is available in the Sardar Sarovar dam but on the total available in the entire basin particularly in MPIn the current year due to installation of gates the storage of water in Sardar Sarovar dam has increased However due to less rainfall other dams of Madhya Pradesh like Indirasagar Bargi Tava and other mediumsize dams have witnessed significant reduction of water storage This makes it clear that our share of water depends on the storage of water by MP Patel saidAccording to former CWC chief A K Bajaj the release of water made it appear as if they authorities wanted to show the Prime Minister that there was plenty of water in the reservoirReferring to the spike Bajaj said This clearly looks like an effort to increase water levels in the reservoir to FRL  metres by a certain targeted date and since both state governments are under the same party the MP government may have obliged GujaratThe water level in the dams reservoir is dependent on two factors upstream release from MP and rainfall in the intermediate catchment areaData show that MP and Gujarat registered deficit rainfall in August and September The upper catchment area of the Narmada in western MP received  mm in August as against the monthly average of  mm East Gujarat received  mm in August against an average of  mmIn September western MP received  against the monthly average of  mm and east Gujarat received  mm as against the average of  mm More specifically in the week before the dams inauguration there was heavy rainfall only on September  as measured as spot rainfall in one upstream dam in MP with light to moderate rainfall on some days in other locationsThe Sardar Sarovar Dam received an average of  mm as spot rainfall between September   The dam is expected to irrigate  million hectares in Gujarat benefitting  million farmers with a canal network of approximately  km length within the stateThe higher the water levels more area between the sea and the canal level can be irrigated benefitting more farmers across Gujarat Compared to other rivers the area of the main Narmada river is very limited It is only the side branches and tributaries that can be used effectively for

indicated that Congress president Rahul Gandhis visits to temples was an attempt to shed that perceptionThe BJP has managed to I dont say brainwash because that is a rude word but it has managed to convince people to persuade people that the Congress party is a Muslim party In my party the great majority is Hindu Yes there are Muslims too So I fail to understand this branding us as a Muslim party she said at the India Today Conclave in MumbaiShe also said the Congress had been pushed into a corner and so felt the need to draw attention rather than keeping quiet to Rahuls frequent temple visits before the Gujarat assembly elections in December  Then his visits had sparked a debate on whether the Congress party was resorting to soft HindutvaGandhi said that as a family they have always visited temples but never made it a spectacle We have always been to temples When I used to travel with Rajiv wherever we went we would visit at least one major important temple We never made a show of it It was quite a natural thing Rahul has gone to temples before she saidAsked if Rahuls temple visits were aimed at not letting the BJP monopolise the Hindutva movement she said There is a bit of that because we have been pushed into a corner Perhaps rather than going to a temple quietly may be a little more public focus on thatIn her address Gandhi a Member of Parliament from Rae Bareli also took on the Narendra Modiled NDA government She said Indias liberal and open democracy was giving way under the ruling establishments dangerous design and the countrys social DNA was being reengineered Political opponents are being targeted through the misuse of investigative agencies The judiciary is in turmoil civil society is being silenced universities and students are being straightjacketed Much of the media is being coerced away from its proper watchdog role which is surely to expose misgovernance scams and frauds said GandhiThe noise of politics is the music of

Nivedita Bhasin  has done it all in a career spanning over four decades The excitement is still there says the Delhibased pilot She comes across as candid and softspoken during an hourlong conversation at a coffee shop in Delhi When I was a young girl my eyes were always turned to the sky Now when I am flying I always look through the window she saysNivedita Bhasin Air India Photo Credit VV KrishnanAs a young girl Bhasin always knew she wanted to be a pilot I dont know how it started but I was always fascinated by airplanes It never occurred to me that flying a plane might be difficult for a girl she says Her dream was to fly the biggest aircraft for the erstwhile Indian Airlines She achieved that goal in  when she captained the Airbus A which was the biggest aircraft then Now she flies the  Dreamliner She attributes her success to a simple mantra from her father If you start something finish it Bhasin who flew for the first time when she was  became the youngest woman pilot in the country when she commanded a commercial flight in  at the age of  I first went to a flying club But the clerk there scoffed at me Go back and study he said So she went to a gliding club instead By  she had started taking passengers on joyrides My friends thank me to this day for the joyrides they enjoyed with meShe got her licence in  Not long after she saw an Indian Airlines advertisement seeking pilots I studied really hard to make the cut It was a doordie situation In  Bhasin joined Indian Airlines as a pilot  only the third woman in the companys history to do so The first woman pilot for Indian Airlines was Captain Durba Banerjee who joined in  followed by Captain Saudamini Deshmukh who joined in At first it was like being in a sea of men recalls Bhasin It was very lonely Some captains I flew with were very encouraging some nasty It was a mixed bag She also encountered paranoid passengers who preferred to change flights rather than be flown by a woman pilot The Bhasin family is a unique aviator family The love of flying is common among three generations  Bhasin and her husband their son and daughter and her late fatherinlawIn  Bhasin was asked to fly to wartorn Libya as part of a government rescue mission to bring home the Indians stranded there I did the first flight to Tripoli It was heartwrenching to see the conditions there The airport there had somewhat rudimentary navigational facilities and uncertainty loomed large she explained adding We would spend hours on the ground at Tripoli not knowing when we could return to India as we were dependant on the Indian passengers being released by the Embassy in TripoliAs soon as the flight landed in Delhi the crew informed Bhasin that someone wanted to meet her It was my Calcutta neighbour from  years ago She was weeping when she saw me and thanked me for getting her back home safely I will never forget that These are moments where you feel god has planned things for youBreaking barriersOne Monday morning last February under clear skies and perfect weather conditions a MiG Bison fighter jet took off from Indian Air Forces IAF Jamnagar Air Force station The sortie was like any other undertaken every day as part of routine training except that as the jet went supersonic it not only broke the sound barrier but many other barriers as well for in the cockpit was Flying Officer Avani Chaturvedi  the first Indian woman to fly a solo sortie on a fighter aircraftWhen we sit in the cockpit and close the canopy any feelings of achievement empowerment and so on are left on the ground We dont carry them in the air The aircraft is so fast and the reaction time for any situation is so little that we dont have time to think about anything else says Chaturvedi when asked what was going through her mind as she pushed the jet to  kmphAvani Chaturvedi Indian Air Force Photo Credit Shanker ChakravartyOn this flight which lasted about  minutes she performed what is called the perfect leaving and rejoin as per set procedure What that means is a take off go to the general flying area and then circle back to land she explains Chaturvedi along with Bhawana Kanth and Mohana Singh are Indias first batch of women fighter pilots and were commissioned into the IAF in July  They have since been undergoing the final phase of training on the Advanced Jet Trainers AJT before graduating to fly the supersonic fightersIn October  the government decided to open up the fighter stream for women on an experimental basis for five years The second batch of three women trainee pilots in the fighter stream have already been selected and are undergoing training at the Air Force training academy However combat roles in the Army and Navy are still off limits due to a combination of operational concerns and logistical constraints Women also constitute a very small fraction of the nearly  millionstrong Indian armed forces which makes the achievement of the three women fighter pilots all the more remarkableOn her second sortie of the day during the training when Chaturvedi was rolling for take off there was a warning on the canopy audio which caused some confusion But her training kicked in and she decided not to take off That day I realised how the decision of a split second can get the situation under control or push it out of control Had I delayed my decision to abort take off or gone airborne with the canopy open the consequences could have been catastrophic she saysThe IAF has a threestage process for training pilots Stage  consists of  hours of flying in a basic trainer in a Pilatus PC aircraft at Dundigal academy Hyderabad Stage  is in an intermediate jet trainer on the Kiran aircraft for  hours at Hakimpet Air Force station Hyderabad After this the cadets are commissioned into service and segregated into streams like helicopter transport and fighter Those qualified for fighter training proceed to the Stage  advanced training of  hours in the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers at Bidar After this officers begin further training to fly the supersonic fighter jets The specific aircraft one trains on depends on the squadron assignedThe transition from Hawk to MiG is gradual and there is a structured syllabus to become an operational pilot says Chaturvedi She started Hawk training in July  after getting commissioned completed it in October last year and got posted to No  Squadron which flies the MiG Bison She spent oneandahalf months in ground training including on MiG simulatorsIt took almost four months to go solo she says The time taken to fly a solo sortie varies from person to person and also depends on a lot of variables She added that her course mates the other two women pilots were undergoing advanced training and will perform solo sorties soon My next objective is to become a fullfledged operational pilotSuch advanced training has been a first of sorts for the three women pilots as well the Air Force So how does it feel to be part of an allmale team It was new for the people in the squadron as they were seeing a woman for the first time says Chaturvedi They were very welcoming and we share the same facilities Ultimately a pilot is a pilot It does not matter whether youre a man or a woman', 'Women', 'Shobana,rebel,Chennais Avvai Shanmugam Salai Her,Aadith,Shivani

video celebrating Balkrishna Doshi the  laureate on Vimeo httpstcoOuADemgUjMAt the recent rd World Congress on Vedic Sciences in Pune he spoke on Architecture and Vedic Insights Speaking of his experience designing the NIFT building Delhi he said How do you create a building that will adjust itself over time A building without constraints I considered the myth of the city in terms of migrations and movement When you build an idea around a space the client gets excited about the space and is more flexible to design ideasIn conversation with this reporter after the event Dr Doshi discussed sustainability at greater length For him it is not just a contemporary catchphrase it is the ethos of architectural design Sustainability he says it is something which can hold itself for a long time  without losing much energy It is like somebody lives a long life and doesnt need much money or much sustenance So it is like selfgenerating balancing way of using energy Citing IIM Bangalore one of his many iconic designs he says it doesnt need to spend money to be sustainable because it is natural stone and there are creepers The building that I design automatically happens to be sustainableAmdavad ni Gufa a museum displaying MFHussains works on IIMs Ahmedabad campus is one of his most experimental projects The most memorable creative design experience for him was all the architectural rules he flouted There are professional rules structural rules of balance and rules of how does it look like something else So I was really trying to think fighting with the crowd What I did is a really completely new structure like soap bubbles with brass But then how do you create them So I found ferrocement designed on the computer built by the tribalsAbout one of his sustainable architecture explorations the Aranya lowcost housing township in Indore in the early s Dr Doshi asks What is the notion of shelter Shelter is sacred Shelter could be transitory or permanent Its in our mind Lowcost housing means empowering people  so that they find their own identity and grow beyondChance Dr Doshi says is important Accidents become a part of architectural expression Where there is chaos or order there are hidden opportunities Since Im not sure about my design Im open to my surroundings While considering design he incorporates the existing environment to enhance inherent characteristics For example we look at whether you need to have more energy for air conditioning or is it comfortable by using only nice brick walls or a hollow wall and proper orientation If I get a good breeze some good trees or some water body and the breeze goes through then it will be very cool comfortable I dont need air conditioning Then if I have proper windows at the proper place which reflect light then I dont need to use a lot more electric energy So that is how to design a building which is sustainable and also doesnt use much energy money material and maintenanceWhen he follows his instincts he says Spaces begin to flow structures begin to flow walls begin to flow What he focusses on is a set of questions How do you make materials speak How do materials sing with you How can materials induce you to become aliveAt  Dr Doshi is still looking for answers for the kumbhaka the gap within Between inhaling and exhaling there is a gap That gap is what were looking for in a building Among the projects hes associated with is Naduhl named for the Tamil word which means inner centre an initiative in Pune promoting energetic architecture He explains that it fits his own

finding a way out of the current mess in the banking system and improve the private investment cycleThis was the key message that came out of a panel discussion with the former Governors of the Reserve Bank of India C Rangarajan and D Subbarao and the former Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh AhluwaliaThe most important thing what we need to do is to get investments Monetary policy alone cannot bring growth Investment rate is falling So we need to do a whole lot of things to bring investments Dr Subbarao said during the panel discussion moderated by R Srinivasan Editor BusinessLineMr Ahluwalia said that in addition to improving the investment cycle the banking system needed to be fixed There should be high priority in resolving the banking mess that has been created over the past three or four years The banks should get back to lending This is not a monetary policy issue Clearly the RBI and the government have a role since  of the banks are still public sector banks Mr Ahluwalia saidAsked what should be done by policy makers going forward Dr Rangarajan prescribed consultation with the industry to see how the investments could be brought inIt is obvious that the economy is performing below potential The economy can grow at  Monetary policy will not be able to do much here to stimulate growth Even if interest rate is lowered I am not sure if the banks are in a position to pass it on They have other problems like NPAs nonperforming assets The government also cannot raise the public investment by more than a few decimal points Dr Rangarajan saidThe private investment rate has fallen from  of the GDP to something like  Government should call the industry and find out what is really coming in the way of higher investments More focussed attention to individual sectors of the industry would be a good thing to do he saidDr Subbarao said the ongoing inflation targeting framework had worked well so far but had not been testedThe test will come when the growth is low and inflation is high It has worked reasonably well so far but it has not been tested Test will also come when there is capital inflows when there is pressure on the exchange rate What will the RBI do then Will it control the inflation or will it manage the exchange rate These are the questions for which one cannot lay down the rules and one needs to play it by the ball as per the situation he saidMr Ahluwalia criticised the Centres move to increase custom duties Domestic production can be better protected by having a more realistic exchange rate rather than increasing the import duties It is a very regrettable step he saidDr Rangarajan said that while growth was important it had to be consistent with some level of stability to make the growth sustainable You cannot have inflation at  and then say growth is important he saidMr Ahluwalia said that policy makers were always in a dilemma In reality politicians have a tough job because they are interested not just in keeping inflation low but they are interested in lower inflation in every commodity The Finance Minister will be terrified of a news item that says prices of onions have shot up even if other agricultural prices are low he saidThe former Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission said there was excessive focus on monetary policy to drive growth We are upset that the RBI is following the rule but we dont seem to mind that the fiscal deficit have been departing from the rule If you ask the question that which part of the economy is not following the rule set a few years ago then it is clearly the fiscal deficit We keep postponing the deadline to meet the fiscal deficit targets It is difficult to understand why it would depart from the rule next year if GDP is growing at  and the tax structure has stabilised So the destabilising influences are not just on the monetary side but also on the fiscal side he said', 'economy', 'cycleThis,banks,government,growth,saidDr

not India Its a vulgar simplistic childish idea of India It has been promoting hypocrisy beyond belief she said setting off a blistering start to the session titled Coming of age the mainstreaming of parallel cinema She felt Bollywood was overly representative of Indian cinema when a lot of experimentation is happening in cinema in all languages across IndiaThe scathing attack on Bollywood came in light of a query by Veena Venugopal moderator and Associate Editor The Hindu about Shahs recent criticism of Dabangg She felt that the film sent out scary objectionable messages about women It does not talk well about our civilisation she saidActordirector Suhasini Mani Ratnam compared watching a film with reading a book You see a film at a go cant stop midway nor put it down like a book and come back to it later But if with digitisation you can watch the film at your convenience then the divide between commercial and parallel cinema will be wiped off she said carrying the debate forward She went back to the roots of art house cinema how it emerged as an act of rebellion against oppression All art cinema is not great some of the films can put you to sleep she said But she felt that there was a growing breed of filmmakers now who were not using cinema to make a statement or to get noticedOne of them Amit Masurkar the director of the critically acclaimed Newton spoke about how people wondered why he was making a film on politics They had this perception that the youth were not interested in politics while Masurkar believed politics was another form of entertainment for people For an independentminded filmmaker like him the struggle was not about getting a film made or selling and exhibiting it The struggle is in getting the right ideas he saidWhen quizzed about the role of actors in bridging the gap between mainstream and commercial cinema Suhasini Mani Ratnam said that it was the audience that was the key in filling up the divide But If an actor decides to support a good film nothing like it she said In Tamil cinema Shivaji Ganesan experimented with small new films followed by Kamal Hassan and Rajinikanth in the beginning Aamir Khan Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar had been trying it in BollywoodShah differed hoping that actors would be cast for their suitability than their stardom She spoke about the young filmmakers of the s who gravitated towards stars They depleted the directors rather than feed them Even a wellmeaning star brings a certain amount of baggage she saidIn response to that Masurkar spoke about working with younger actors like Rajkummar Rao who do not come from film families They realise that they will have to work hard to go ahead he saidHe spoke of himself as the first generation of filmmakers who did not just discover films online but even picked up his filmmaking skills from the InternetBut can that equal being in a film school with passionate mentors and peers for company and constant conversations on cinema Suhasini evocatively spoke about being the only woman among  men in the film school Even that did not prepare her for her tryst with international cinema She broke down on watching Bicycle ThievesIt made her realise what cinema could do what her future in filmmaking was going to be like In  at the age of  it could only happen at a film institute she saidMasurkar disagreed vehemently that independent films like his were still confined to a small urban niche Newton was released in Chhattisgarh Jharkhand and Gorakhpur It ran for four weeks in Dalli RajharaShah said the audience had

possibility of forming the next government in Tamil NaduThe yearold film star on Friday said he will try to form the next government in the southern state where politics is dominated largely by two regional parties  the AIADMK and the DMK  and emerge as the third alternativeHaasan recently launched his political party Makkal Needhi Maiam Peoples Justice Centre in Tamil Nadu where the next Assembly elections are due in Asked what will be his message to the ruling AIADMK and the main opposition DMK he shot back saying Mend your ways or we will step inWhen asked specifically if he is trying to say that his party will form the government after the next elections the actorpolitician said Yes we will tryIt is not my voice alone that is speaking the strength comes from my people I am looking for the welfare of the people with their participation that is a vision he said Haasan asserted he will not compromise on his ideals at any cost and maintained his decision to join politics was not spontaneous but culmination of a well thoughtout processLosing an election is not that daunting as losing your ideals Losing an election is not a big thing I have lost many elections thinking I have voted for the right party But they did not make it the wrong man made it to the top I felt I have lost But that will go on he saidHaasan considers himself a social service leader and not an organiser and says he has been functioning below the radar for about  yearsNow we have more than six lakh members working with me You think this idea of coming into politics is overnight I dont think so I have been thinking about it since the turn of the millenniumBut I was not sure how my great heroes did it without coming into politics I thought I could pull it off like them but times have changed We cannot pull it off that way he said Haasan said way back in  he had thought of stepping into politics but held back Then in  he had almost taken the plunge but then felt he should not get there at all the actorpolitician saidI thought my heroes like Mahatma Gandhi ji and Periyar social reformer and founder of Dravidian movement were able to do it without getting into electoral politics The difference is I became political longlong time ago nearly  years ago I wanted to be part of it But I felt electoral politics is not for me he recalledAsked what made him float his own outfit instead of joining existing parties like the AIADMK Haasan said What will I do when I am very hungry and I want to eat and what is available to me is rotten foodHowever it does not mean the Makkal Needhi Maiam will not have any electoral alliance in the future he said adding one cannot dismiss it tieups as that will sound arrogant and despoticWe will have to see who we can align with who has similar passion at least if not ideologyProd him further if he has any such people in mind pat comes the reply I am looking I am not shoppingThe veteran actor said any alliance in the future will be based on certain ideas plans and programme implementation if not ideologyFor Haasan fighting corrupt politicians and people with criminal antecedents is of utmost importance and he will never join hands with such elementsIn English a pickpocket is called a thiefIf a bank manager does it it is called embezzlement and then it becomes a scam and an oversight I think all are thieves when you touch other peoples moneyAsked if he will become a mascot around which the CPIM will try and revive its political fortunes the actor said I dont think so I will borrow a line from Edward De Bono  we always work in yes or no either positive or negative We dont think there is a third alternative But there isThat is why Mr Edward De Bono wrote a book Po Beyond Yes No He invented the word Po There is a third alternative We want to be the third alternativeTalking about his journey in life Haasan said he always aspired to be a writer but his mentor K Balachander advised him to become an actorThe actor said he would have happily retired by now but decided to take on more responsibilities as he wanted to produce and direct more filmsI did my first  films in first ten years and I have not crossed the

which acting might come in the way If I were to take an office I cannot be doing that I better get prepared for thatAsked if he will go back to films after his political plunge the Vishwaroopam star said It can come back in nostalgia may be not as an option of a second career now I always say in all my meetings that I had never thought to be an actor or be in office Thanks to my teachers I became

(42, 'SC recognises living will of terminally ill patient to die with dignity', 'In a landmark judgement the Supreme Court on Friday recognised that a terminallyill patient or a person in a persistent vegetative state can execute an advance medical directive or a living will to refuse medical treatment saying the right to live with dignity also includes smoothening the process of dyingA fivejudge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra observed that the failure to legally recognise advance medical directives may amount to nonfacilitation of the right to smoothen the dying process and the dignity in that process was also a part of the right to life under Article  of the ConstitutionThe apex court laid down principles relating to the procedure for execution of advance directive or living will and spelt out guidelines and safeguards to give effect to passive euthanasia in both circumstances that is where there are advance directives and where there are noneThe directive and guidelines shall remain in force till Parliament brings a legislation in the field CJI Misra writing the judgement for himself and Justice A M Khanwilkar saidThe other three judges of the bench  Justices A K Sikri D Y Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan  penned separate concurring verdicts in the combined judgement running into  pagesJustice Chandrachud writing a separate page verdict said that life and death were inseparable and it was necessary for the court to recognise that dignity of citizens continues to be safeguarded by the Constitution even when the life is seemingly lost and questions about our own mortality confront us in the twilight of existenceDignity in the process of dying is as much a part of the right to life under Article  To deprive an individual of dignity towards the end of life is to deprive the individual of a meaningful existence Hence the Constitution protects the legitimate expectation of every person to lead a life of dignity until death occurs he saidIn his page judgement the CJI noted that in case of a terminallyill patient or a person in persistent vegetative state PVS where there was no hope of recovery accelerating the process of death for reducing the period of suffering constitutes a right to live with dignityRight to life and liberty as envisaged under Article  is meaningless unless it encompasses within its sphere the individual dignity the CJI said adding Though the sanctity of life has to be kept on the high pedestal yet in cases of terminallyill persons or PVS patients where there is no hope for revival priority shall be given to the advance directive and the right of selfdeterminationJustice Sikri who wrote a page separate verdict concurred with the directions given by the CJI and hoped that the Legislature would step in at the earliest and enact a comprehensive law on living willadvance directive so that there is a proper statutory regime to govern various aspects and nuances thereof which also take care of the apprehensions that are expressed against euthanasiaWriting a separate but concurring page judgement Justice Bhushan reiterated the conclusion arrived at in a  judgement by a constitution bench in the Gian Kaur case that the right to die with dignity is a fundamental rightWe declare that an adult human being having mental capacity to take an informed decision has the right to refuse medical treatment including withdrawal from lifesaving devices Justice Bhushan said adding that a person of competent mental faculty is entitled to execute an advance medical directive in accordance with the safeguards spelt out by the courtThe top court also held that when passive euthanasia as a situational palliative measure becomes applicable the best interest of the patient shall override the state interestThe CJI said though there was no legal framework in India as regards to the advance medical directive the apex court was obliged to protect the right of the citizens enshrined under Article  of the ConstitutionIn our considered opinion advance medical directive would serve as a fruitful means to facilitate the fructification of the sacrosanct right to life with dignity he saidThe said directive we think will dispel many a doubt at the relevant time of need during the course of treatment of the patient That apart it will strengthen the mind of the treating doctors as they will be in a position to ensure after being satisfied that they are acting in a lawful manner the CJI saidThe apex court also laid down guidelines as to who could execute the advance directive and how what should it contain how should it be recorded and preserved when and by whom can it be given effect to what if permission is refused by the medical board and also in the event of revocation or inapplicability of advance directiveThe court also spelt the guidelines to be followed in cases where there would be no advance directive saying that such persons cannot be alienatedThe verdict by the

a question and answer session the UPA chairperson spoke on a wide range of topics including her children her own shortcomings and the role of democracy in India the first time she has opened up since relinquishing the party president postGandhi was addressing an event in MumbaiGandhis noholdsbarred attack came a day after her son and Congress President Rahul Gandhi hit out at the BJP alleging there is a general atmosphere of intimidation in India where nasty form of politics of dividing people are being played to win electionsDuring the interactive session Sonia Gandhi alleged that the Modi governments lack of accommodative spirit has led to the present politics of acrimony in Parliament which has been rocked by disruptions during this entire weekGandhi also said she chose Manmohan

maximum governance mean minimum truth Does it mean alternative facts take the place of uncomfortable reality Take jobs for instance Everyone knows employment situation is grim but all of a sudden we are told seven and a half million jobs were created in This claim was widely debunked But does it really make a difference It doesnt Because as soon as one myth is demolished another takes it place

(73, 'A  billion pipeline has surprise patrons Taliban militants', 'After decades of talks Afghanistan finally broke ground last month on a  billion gas pipeline that will run through areas controlled by the Taliban Even more surprising The militant group is backing the projectThe Taliban deems it its responsibility to revive foundational economic and reconstruction work in the country and asks international construction companies to help the Afghans in this regard Zabihullah Mujahed a spokesman said in a statement last month noting that talks on the pipeline dated back to when the Taliban governed the nationThe endorsement from a group that has fought the USbacked government in Kabul for the past  years raises a slight hope for a political settlement even as violence continues to rage President Ashraf Ghani last week presented his most comprehensive peace offering yet to the Taliban which controls or contests nearly half the country Hes open to recognizing the group as a political movement and would help remove international sanctionsAfter the projects completion it will have some sort of positive impact on peace talks between the Taliban and the government said Harun Mir a political analyst in Kabul The Taliban who live there can benefit too and that may open the gate for talksThe TurkmenistanAfghanistanPakistanIndia pipeline will eventually carry an annual  billion cubic meters of gas creating thousands of jobs and generating more than  million in annual revenue for the cashstrapped government in Kabul Stateowned Turkmengaz Afghan Gas Enterprise and GAIL India Ltd are among companies working on the projectThe Afghan section of the pipeline  about  miles passing through some Talibancontrolled areas  is scheduled to be finished in two years It will then reach Pakistan before crossing its heavily fortified border with IndiaEnsuring security will be crucial as its runs along a highway in southern Afghanistan that has been beset by frequent attacks Its success also hinges on regional cooperation among countries that have less than rosy relationsWe will have no any enmity relations with any country in the future Ghani told a hundredsstrong audience in Herat at a ceremony attended by Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov Pakistans Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and MJ Akbar Indias junior external affairs minister We just want to secure our national interestGhani didnt detail security arrangements and only briefly suggested that local authorities would be responsible for the pipelines safetyCash incentivesGhanis government has expressed skepticism of the Talibans intentions The administration wont make payments to the Taliban and its premature to trust their assurances according to Dawa Khan Menapal a presidential spokesmanFamilies friends and relatives of Taliban can use it as well  so its their responsibility to protect and defend any national projects Menapal saidGhani has a lot riding on the projects success His administration has struggled to implement any meaningful economic gains in the midst of worsening violence across the countryJohn R Bass the US ambassador to Afghanistan tweeted last month that the project will energize regional cooperation and become an important source of revenueThat optimism is being pared with realities on the ground The conflict killed or wounded more than  civilians last year according to the United Nations In January the Taliban claimed attacks in the capital that killed and wounded hundreds Islamic State has also slowly extended its reach in AfghanistanMutual allegationsEven if the Taliban has said they wont cause problems there are many other militant groups that could said Michael Kugelman a senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington Also the Taliban could well change its mindRelations between Pakistan and Afghanistan are also at a nadir amid mutual allegations that both nations support terror groups striking each other Its also questionable whether India will rely on a pipeline that passes through its northern archrivalThe present circumstances of heightened IndiaPakistan tension and

Rahul Gandhis interaction at a university in the city stateRahul Gandhi supports talks on JK issue says bad political decision responsible for current turmoilThe clip the party posted juxtaposes an audience question critical of the Congress with a second one  an audience comment really  heaping praise on it and then shows Rahuls answer  a rather humorous answer  to the second questionWith political discourse hitting new lows everyday Congress President Rahul Gandhi shows how to gracefully handle httpstcolTlpEsDM Congress INCIndia The man who asked the first question is Prasenjit Basu an economist and author of a book called Asia Reborn Hes the one peeved that the Congress posted a video that shows his question but not Rahuls answer to his question The video isnt exactly doctored but Basu calls it a classic fakenews video The Congress didnt even censor Basus critical question it just chose to highlight an answer that Rahul gave later in his interaction which referred to Basus question The author though believes the Congress is using his image to falsely advertise the party President Withdraw this false video or prepare for prosecution in Singapores courts tweeted an iratesounding BasuINCIndia This is a classic fakenews video You are using my image to falsely advertise your politician showing a httpstcolHHQUlIa Prasenjit K Basu PrasenjitKBasu This was the question Basu asked Why is it that during the years that your family ruled India Indias per capita income was growing less than the world average And yet in the years since your family relinquished the prime ministership of India Indias per capita income has grown substantially faster than the world average In its video clip of the interaction the Congress cuts after this to a comment about Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress I am a great admirer of your greatgrandfather Jawaharlal Nehru and I think all the good things wherever India is today its because of the Congress this audience member saidThe clip then shows Rahuls rather humorous response to a comment even he recognised for its fawning toneYou are both going to extremes I mean give me something in the middle I mean hes Basus saying I am the cause of every single problem And you are saying Im the cause of every single solution I mean this is crazy said RahulThe Congress president then said that these extreme views reflected how polarised India has becomeThis conversation shows you the polarisation That gentleman Basu thinks that nothing has ever been done by the Congress party This gentleman second speaker thinks that everything has been done by the Congress party said Rahul as the audience burst out laughingThe Congress president also got in a dig at Basu as he explained that he believes Indias success is due to its people and not because of the Congress or despite of it Let me tell you what the truth is Indias success is hugely because of Indias people However anybody in this room who thinks that the Congress party is not part of that successthinks liberalisation wasnt a successgreen revolution was not a success needs to write a new book he said very likely referring to Basu whose book was published in September last year In his answer the Congress president also trained his guns on Narendra Modi and took a subtle dig at him by offering to hug Basu The Congress has often been critical of what it calls Modis hugplomacy  the PMs fondness for hugging other world leadersI am proud to sit in a room and have a gentleman say this critical comments to me Now theres something else Mr Narendra Modi would never do that You would never have the ability to say what you said to me in front of Mr Narendra Modi and am absolutely blazingly proud of that said RahulAfter this meeting I want
