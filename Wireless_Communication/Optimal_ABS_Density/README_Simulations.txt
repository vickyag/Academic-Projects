* On the left, in the Current Window pane, navigate to the path where the 'Simulations' folder is extracted.

* Once there, right click on the 'Simulations' folder and select 'ADD TO PATH' ->  'SELECTED FOLDERS AND SUBFOLDERS'.

* Open the folder and open the file with the name 'main'.

* Run the file 'main', all the resultant graphs will be plotted over 500 simulations.

NOTE : 

Result values can be seen in the workspace. All the variable names are parallel to what they store.

Thank You.
